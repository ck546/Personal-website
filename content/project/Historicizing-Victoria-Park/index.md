Located in Causeway Bay, Victoria Park is an iconic space of contention in Hong Kong. Many transnational and local protests have occured in the Park during the colonial and post-colonial periods. For instance, Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China has organized the annual Candlelight Vigil for the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre since 1990. Yet, the British colonial government originally built the Park for recreational purposes to gain legitimacy in the 1950s. **How was the Park transformed from an "empty" space to a "contentious political space"?** Through archival research, Chi Kwok and I demonstrated how the Defend Diaoyutai Islands Movement of the 1970s became a critical juncture of politicizing and re-policing the meanings of Victoria Park.
