Drawing on in-depth interviews with college-aged youth, Brooke Erin Duffy and I introduced the concept of "imagined surveillance" to describe how emerging adults might anticipate the imagined gaze of various social institutions, including family, educators, and (future) employers. Such imaginaries of surveillance, in turn, guided participants' exposure to and engagement with surveillance activities across social media platforms. This project reflected on the wider implications of a surveillance culture across an expansive social media ecology.
